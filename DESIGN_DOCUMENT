Think about: 
 - Output
 - Convetions
 - Where is data structure defined? In JS or in config file. Edited in GUI or in code
 - Features: Input fields, relations?, image uploads?
 - NodeJS or Rust/Go backend


- Drop in -> Parse -> Render fields 

FIELD RENDERING:
- for field in JSON
- field.type -> Inputfield
- field.content -> Value

1. Write JSON Parser -> Renderer

if type in KNOWN_FIELDS {
    render KNOWN_FIELDS[type]
}
